# AWS-S3-static-website

Static websites have fixed content with no back-end processing. 
They can contain HTML pages, images, style sheets and all files required to render the website, but there is no server-side scripting or database. 
If desired, the web pages can provide interactivity and run programming logic by using JavaScript that runs within the user's web browser.
You can easily host a static website on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) by uploading the desired content and making it publicly accessible.

No servers are required and you can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web.In this lab, you will 
•Create a Bucket in Amazon S3
•Upload Content to your Bucket
•Enable Access to the Objects
•Update the Website
